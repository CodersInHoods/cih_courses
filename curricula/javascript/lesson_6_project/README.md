# Project time!

For the last 2 weeks of the course, you'll be building a small project. Go [here](https://github.com/CodersInHoods/js-course-project-example/) to see an example, fork that and read the readme. It's a Single Page Application with some requests of different methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`).

In lesson 5 you'll have some time to get help if you need it, but you have all you need to know to build an SPA using Javascript: events, DOM manipulation and requests.

Good luck!
